Detecting privacy-sensitive human genomic data

The privacy-sensitivity detector is a method that systematically detects privacy-sensitive DNA segments coming directly from an input stream, using as reference a knowledge database of known privacy-sensitive nucleic and amino acid sequences.

The complete documentation about this tool is available in [its Wiki page](https://github.com/vvcogo/privacy-detector/wiki), where you will find how to obtain the necessary knowledge databases, the genomes for testing the tool, and how to use the privacy-sensitivity detector.
